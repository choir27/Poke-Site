## How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, EJS
Building the initial layout, content and design of the website on html, I eventually pushed all of my code onto EJS, determining I could start experimenting a bit more with express and implementing them into projects.  I started small by sending the content for the anime page as a javascript object to heroku so I could host my own public API.  Using fetch, I was able to grab the content for the anime page and have them show in the actualy deployment of the site without having to hard code any of the tags that would be needed, and I also used loops to reduce the amount of repetitive code I would need to write for each heading and image.  I also implemented the same logic with the manga page so I wouldn't need to hard code all of the image tags necessary.  Using loops, conditionals, dom manipulation, and fetch, I was able to have a particular pokemon information show depending on what the user typed into the pokedex input bar.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned to make a plan before building anything, and to make sure I have a general direction that I want to achieve and to develop a plan on how to get there.  Taking the time to develop a general structured plan beforehand showed me how efficient and useful it is to write out what you want build before actually creating it.
